# React Anecdotes Project

Go to https://drewcsontos.github.io/ReactPhoneBook to check out my React project.

This project lets you add names and phone numbers to a phone book and also lets you filter out the names. 

No CSS was used so I could focus on learning React.

Made as an exercise from the course https://fullstackopen.com/en/.
